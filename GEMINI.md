## Gemini Added Memories
- Fllow instructions in this file strictly.
- When the user types the special command `$commit`, I must execute a specific workflow: 1. Identify staged files using `git diff --cached --name-only`. 2. Analyze the content of staged changes using `git diff --cached`. 3. Infer the change type (feat, fix, refactor, etc.), scope, and main intent from the diff. 4. Generate a single-line commit message in English following the Conventional Commits standard (`<type>(<scope>): <subject>`) and matching the style from `git log --oneline`. The message must be imperative and have no period. The word after the scope (egg: "feat:" or similar) must start with lowercase letter. 5. My output must be ONLY the generated commit message string, with no explanations, comments, or other text. Don't ever add other files to git or commit, just generate the message.
